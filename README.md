# Let the Computer Check It for You

These are code samples for my article. I suggest reading the article, as these are not too interesting, but if you 
want to see things live and running, this is the place.

Run `test_factorial.py` as Pytest to see multiple unit tests of each implementation;
you can also run `factorial.py` for a doctest.

## Self-referential comment

This is an example of the external documentation: Not inside the code. 
Still, as a README, this is just a file away from the actual code.
A user manual would be even farther away.
