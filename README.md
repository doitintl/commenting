# Let the Computer Check It for You

These are code samples for my article. I suggest reading the article, as these are not too interesting, but if you 
want to see things live and running, this is the place.

Run `factorial.py` to see the values printed out, and run `test_factorial.py` as Pytest to see unit tests of each implementation.

## Self-referential comment

This is an example of the external documentation: Not inside to the code. 
Still, as a README, this is just a file away from the actual code.
